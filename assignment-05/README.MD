
I decided to look into an old gaming website that I used to use back in the days of the original "World of Warcraft" game called "MMO-Champion.com" back in 2009.
Funnily enough, back then there wasn't a huge amount of data on playing the game like there is now, even though more people played it back then. 
So i remember the website pretty well having spent a decent amount of time on there checking new updates and forum posts.
Wouldn't you know it but.. it hasn't changed barely at all. Sure, some updates with social media being bigger and the ability to link other websites data is there.
But the overall website looks exactly the same. I guess they already had their brand somewhat set so they decided to keep it!
