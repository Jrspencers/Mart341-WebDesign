Typography is the way in which a web designer or developer convey most of the information they are trying to present. It is the way in which the letters, text, images, etc are laid out in an appealing and clear manner.

Having fallback fonts or a font stack is important incase the main or primary choice of fonts fails or takes longer to load to provide a buffer for the webpage to load.

The main difference between system fonts, web fonts, and web-safe fonts is the way in which they are intended to be used and/or stored for use interchangably.
