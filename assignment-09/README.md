Looking back I actually wish I had learned some minor coding earlier in my college career. It is a lot more logical and easier than i expected. I really have enjoyed your videos as they are easy to follow and allow me/others to still do the assignment and I think that really helps me retain it all. I regret not having more time to be able to enjoy the class more but I am glad that I have taken this class thus far.

I always look forward to more challenging content. I also like the idea of being able to create more complicated and interesting webpages or at least have an understanding of them.
