I think when it comes to Forms I've unknowingly used quite a few, like I would imagine most people would say. Until this class I didn't know thats what was the term to describe a "submit" button or a "checkbox." Going further, would it be safe to assume that actual "forums" online are indeed made up of constant forums as they all are submitted through a textbox? I'm sure anyone in the coding world thinks HTML is basic, but I do enjoy learing why things (or this case websites) work the way they do with the internet being so much apart of our daily lives.
