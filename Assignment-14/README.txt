The user testing was a lot more simple than I thought it would be when reading the instructions. I think if I/we had made more complicated websites that it could have been more interesting for sure.

I managed my space more and got rid of some bloat like the search bar amongst other things that were trivial and I wasn't able to make functional.

I used a major framework from a website I liked online. It was a lot more than I expected and it was a big learning experience to get it to fit a much more simple website than it was designed for. I think it looks good in the end because of it though.
