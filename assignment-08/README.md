1. An Affordance is essentially the limit at which a user can use something up too their own capabilities. I had to read a little more to be able to explain it without just regurgitating the same definition. An example would be a search bar on a website that says search. The majority of users in this day and age would have the affordance and capability to know what that means and use it to search the website.

2. I think the advantages of both Youtube and Vimeo to host your videos is that they are both free and very user friendly. Disadvatages now days might be copyright issues or sharability (like i ran into this week with Elvis music) on ones personal website.

Going furth that was one challenge I had this week was just finding a video that had any relevance from youtube that also let me link it without being "unavailable." I suppose Elvis is a huge name and I didn't think about it when chosing it. I also had a couple issues with the code and realized I needed to pay more attention to detail after fixing it all.
